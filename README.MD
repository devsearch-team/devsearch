## User Stories

### First iteration :

In our first iteration of creating the user stories, we created them based heavily on technical requirements

As an employer I want to be able to:

- Create an employer account and store my information in my employer profile so I can become an employer in DevSearch.
- Log in using my unique profile so I can use the application. 
- Create a job so job seekers can see it.
- Update the status of the job applications to either accepted for interview, hired, rejected.

### Second Iteration :

We decided to create user stories based on the user needs and perspective, we started creating a list of the employer wants and began a job seeker list to add multiple stories per feature.

As an employer I want to:
1. Advertise available job positions in my company, so I can find the right person for the job.
2. Have a company profile so the job seekers can see the companies details within the job advertisement page.
3. Manage and track the hiring process entirely using the application so I do not lose track of the application.
4. Check the applicant details for each application so I can reject them or proceed with the hiring process.
5. Download applicants resumes so I can have a printable version if it.
6.  Set an interview time from the calendar so the job seeker can accept it or reject it. 
7. Reject applicants after receiving their job applications or after interviewing them so I can keep track of the hiring process.
8. Make an offer to an applicant so the applicant accepts it or rejects it.
9. Use the application from my phone, so I can access it when outside of office.
10. Visually differentiate the job applications based on where they are at the hiring process, so I can better picture my job applications and easily proceed the hiring process. As an employer I want to:
